### __ByteDance（Senior iOS Developer）__ `Mar 2020 – Present`
- Experiment Suite<br>
    - iOS Experiment Infrastructure: Built Swift-based A/B testing suite from scratch (precise exposure, local bucketing), supporting tiered caching and async batch reporting → Reduced performance cost from ms to µs, cutting 50K ANRs/day.<br>
    - Cost Optimization: Group-level incremental updates (↓90% bandwidth), real-time updates (30 min for 80% coverage), and automatic tagging, recycling, and solidification → Saved over ¥20M annually. <br>
    - Attribution: Offline experiment automation testing, online issue tracing/debugging platform → Reduced troubleshooting time to <15 minutes, improving client stability. <br>
- Limited Hotfix Framework: Supports multithread protection, method interception/replacement, return value modification → Enables dynamic client issue patching.<br>
- Routing Framework: Unified endpoint-level consistency (annotation & static checks) and platform-level registration → Ensured consistent navigation across platforms
- Performance Optimization (Launch & Smoothness)<br>
    - Launch: Preload decompression + ld64 binary reordering + cold start tuning → Launch time ↓100ms, first screen ↓400ms.<br>
    - Smoothness: Metrics (e.g., drop3 ↓5ms/s), business collab strategy tuning (defer, async, prefetch, stagger), container-level optimizations (LynxAir).<br>
